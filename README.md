This Next.js project uses the `app` directory instead of the `pages` directory.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

Replace the values with your own configuration.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser.
## Other Scripts
- npm run build: Builds the project for production.
- npm start: Starts the production server.
- npm run lint: Runs the linter to check for code quality issues.
Make sure to have the required environment variables set up in the .env file before running any of these scripts.
```
This README highlights the usage of the app directory and the need for a .env file with the necessary environment variables. It provides instructions for running the development server and mentions other available scripts.
